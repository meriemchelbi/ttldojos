Let's Make a 🍅 Timer!

One of the great things about being a coder is that we can make tools to solve our problems.

Let's assume you find it hard to get focused time due to meetings etc. 😉

Wouldn't it be great if we worked in 25 minute blocks, tracked our time spend, and monitored
our interruptions?

Enter the Pomodoro Technique!

It works like this:

- You start a 25 minute timer.
- You focus on a single task for that time.
- You take a 5 minute break at the end.
- Every 4 tomatoes, you get a longer 30 minute break.
- If you get interrupted while on a tomato, you lose the tomato (to account for context switching)


## Tasks

> You may not get all the way through this, it's by design 😊

1. Create a timer that starts a 'tomato' (25 minute block) - you'll see that time can be interesting with TDD 😉
2. Add the ability to take a short (5 min) or long (30 mins) break.
3. Add a count and total time of tomatoes and breaks completed.
4. Add the ability to 'interrupt' a tomato - noting the reason why - note that interrupted tomatoes are 'lost' - you get 0 credit for focus!
5. Add a simple task list, to track tomatoes against.
6. Add estimated tomato count for a task, then compare with actual.
